                health, feel good, and have energy. These nutrients include protein, carbohydrates, fat, water,
                vitamins, and minerals. Nutrition is important for everyone</p>

            <h2>Mutton Steak</h2>
            <p>A steak is a meat generally sliced across the muscle fibers, potentially including a bone. ... For some
                meats, such as pork, lamb and mutton, chevon, and veal, these cuts are often referred to as chops. Some
                cured meat, such as gammon, is commonly served as steak.</p>

            <p>Toss together the cucumber, tomato, onion, pepper, radish, jicama, and lettuce in a large salad bowl.
                Whisk together the garlic, lemon juice, olive oil, pomegranate juice, salt, pepper, dill, basil, and
                water in a small bowl. Drizzle dressing over the salad just before serving.</p>

            <h2>Healthy Breakfast</h2>
            <p>Any nut butter, fruit, dried fruit, yogurt, nut, seed, or jam is fair game. Change up how you prepare
                your oats too. Make baked oatmeal or homemade granola, or prep a big batch of overnight oats for quick
                breakfasts throughout the week. While you're at it, make a batch of homemade oat milk.</p>
